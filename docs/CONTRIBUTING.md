## [Full 4ga Boards Contribution Guidelines](https://4gaboards.com/contribute)

### How Can I Contribute?

#### Reporting Bugs / Adding Suggestions

Feel free to create a bug report as a new issue on GitHub. Before creating, please check if there is already existing one. When creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

#### Pull Requests

If you want you can discuss your ideas with the team by creating an issue, or commenting on an existing one. You can also discuss using a PR. This will result in a much higher likelihood of your code being accepted.

If you’re looking for ways to get started, here's a list of ways to help us improve 4ga Boards:

- Bugs and other issues listed on GitHub
- New features development
- Performance improvements, both on client and server
- Translations into other languages
- Documentation

### Styleguides

#### Git Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://conventionalcommits.org), so changelogs could be generated automatically by that.

Additional rules:

- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
- Each commit should be a single, stable change

#### JavaScript

All JavaScript code should follow this [JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). The pre-commit hook will help you find linting errors before committing.
